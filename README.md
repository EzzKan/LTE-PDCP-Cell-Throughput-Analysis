# LTE-PDCP-Cell-Throughput-Analysis

## KPI Parameters analysed are Packet Data Convergence Protocal (PDCP),Physical Resource Block (PRB) ,Radio Resource Control (RRC) connected users & Modulation Coding Scheme(MCS)

1.To check the correlation between the effect of increased PDCP context vs PRB ,MCS & RRC connected users for various eNodeB's

2.Option to create ML model that predicts LTE cell throughputs for a given eNodeB by improving the selection of MCS and improving PRB utilisation

An analysis of cell throughtput using PRB, PDCP ,RRC & MCS to determine various methods for doing LTE Radio Network Planning & Optimization to improve DL Cell throughput.
